=========================================

> Note: this example is currently experimental and requires advanced knowledge of Qt!

This is a small chat application using the managed WebSockets provided by Qt Cloud Services.

This example requires the Qt WebSockets module which is part of Qt 5.3. It can be run with Qt 5.3.0-beta1 and onwards.

When building the example you need to have a Managed WebSocket instance running and copy the MWS_GATEWAY_ID and MWS_INSTANCE_ADDRESS into mainwindow.cpp.
